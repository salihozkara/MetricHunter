### Inputs

* **Topics:** Topics are used to help developers find and explore repositories on GitHub that are related to a specific
  subjects or theme. For example, a developer who is interested in Learning about Android development might search for
  repositories with the topic "android".
* **Wanted Count:** Wanted count allows developers to specify the number of repositories they want to retrieve when
  using the tool. For example, if a developer wants to search for repositories with the topic "android" and wants to
  retrieve 10 repositories, they would enter "android" in the topics input and "10" in the wanted count input.
* **Language:** Language is used to help developers find and explore repositories on GitHub that are written in a
  specific programming language. For example, a developer who is interested in learning about Android development might
  search for repositories written in Java.
* **Sort by:** Sort by allows developers to specify how they want to sort the repositories they retrieve when using the
  tool. For example, if a developer wants to search for repositories with the topic "android" and wants to retrieve 10
  repositories, they would enter "android" in the topics input, "10" in the wanted count input, and "stars" in the sort
  by input. This would retrieve the 10 repositories with the most stars that have the topic "android".

## GitHub Authentication

It is generally not possible to use MetricHunter without authenticating with a GitHub account. This is because the
GitHub API, which MetricHunter relies on to access and retrieve information about repositories on the platform, requires
authentication in order to access the API.

Authenticating with a GitHub account allows MetricHunter to increase its rate limit, which is the number of requests
that can be made to the API within a certain timeframe. Without authentication, MetricHunter would have a much lower
rate limit, which could limit the functionality of the tool.

It is generally not recommended to use MetricHunter without authenticating with a GitHub account, as this could
significantly limit the functionality of the tool.

### How to Authenticate

To authenticate with a GitHub account, click on the "Authenticate" button in the top right corner of the MetricHunter
window. This will open a new window in your default browser, where you can log in to your GitHub account and grant
MetricHunter access to your account.

Token is saved in your local machine. So you don't need to authenticate again.
